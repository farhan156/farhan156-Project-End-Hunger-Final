                <h2>Causes of Hunger</h2>
                <p>
                    Hunger is a complicated problem that is closely linked to inequality in resource distribution, poverty, conflict, and climate change.
                     Poverty is a powerful catalyst that keeps people and communities in cycles of deprivation and prevents them from having access to enough food and nourishment. 
                     Food shortages develop and communities are displaced as a result of disruptions to the networks that distribute and produce food. These problems are made worse by climate change, 
                     which results in unpredictable weather patterns, crop failures, and decreased agricultural productivity. Furthermore, 
                     food insecurity is sustained by unequal access to resources like markets, water, and land, particularly for vulnerable people. 
                     Developing comprehensive measures to alleviate hunger and achieve the ambitious goals established in the End Hunger campaign requires addressing these linked concerns.

                <h2>Impact of Hunger</h2>
                <p>
                    Hunger affects not just the body but also the economy, society as a whole, and health in particular. 
                    Long-term health problems can arise from chronic hunger because it frequently causes malnutrition, weakened immune systems, stunted growth, and impaired cognitive development, especially in children. 
                    In terms of the economy, hunger prolongs poverty cycles by obstructing societal advancement, economic growth, and production. In terms of society, hunger erodes social cohesiveness and stability, 
                    escalating disparities and fueling migration and war. It is imperative to meet the lofty goals set forth in the End Hunger effort because doing so would not only help to create healthier and more resilient societies, 
                    but it is also a moral obligation.
