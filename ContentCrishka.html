              <p>Hunger is more than just the feeling of an empty stomach. It's a complex issue rooted in poverty, inequality, and lack of access to resources.

                <h1>Causes of Hunger</h1>
              <p>Hunger is not simply a result of food scarcity; it is often driven by a combination of social, economic, and environmental factors. Poverty, conflict, climate change, and inadequate infrastructure all contribute to food insecurity. Understanding these root causes is essential for developing sustainable solutions to address hunger at its core.</p>
